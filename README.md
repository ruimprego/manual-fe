### create react project

I've decided to create the app from scratch, instead of using boilerplate code such as create-react-app, simply because this is a small application and this gives me better control of what dependencies the project has.
Additionally, I've added React as a dependency because, well... This is a React application ðŸ˜€ and ReactDOM to manage the DOM elements of the page
