### create react project

I've decided to create the app from scratch, instead of using boilerplate code such as create-react-app, simply because this is a small application and this gives me better control of what dependencies the project has.
Additionally, I've added React as a dependency because, well... This is a React application ðŸ˜€ and ReactDOM to manage the DOM elements of the page

### import font and create global style

I had to add a file-loader to webpack, so it could import the font-file that we needed for this project. I looked but couldn't find it as a webfont, so I downloaded the free version, which states on it's licence that it can be used freely except for commercial usage.
Typically in react, I like the flexibility that styled-components provide, therefore, for this exercise, I decided to use it, even though I'm familiar with other CSS pre-processors. I've also added a file to set the global styles of the application, as well as a theme file where all the colors of the application will reside.
